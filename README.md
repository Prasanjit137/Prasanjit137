Hi there!
I am Prasanjit, currently purshuing my BTech from Siliguri Institute of Technology in Electrical Engineering.
I am a Hobbyist and a Tech Enthusiast and I love making DIY projects.
I have a keen interest in learning new emerging technologies.
I love to code in Python and I do believe Python is really fun. 
Currently I started learning Flutter to gain some more potential in the App Development segment.
I do have a youtube channel as well (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmOGwy5DjDUcMJKKO7neI1w).

You can drop me a mail at ps.ee.1846@gmail.com or can connect through linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasanjit-sarkar-855370154).
